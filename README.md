# üè≠ Mamata Machinery Machine Learning Project: Innovating Manufacturing with AI üè≠

I am excited to share my latest project, where we applied machine learning to enhance operational efficiency, optimize pricing, and improve customer satisfaction for Mamata Machinery. Here's how AI made a difference in the manufacturing sector:

## üìä Dataset Highlights:

Key Attributes: Manufacturing cost, units produced/sold, market price, revenue, and customer ratings.

## üöÄ Key Solutions & Achievements:

1. **Fault Detection**:
   - Developed a Random Forest Classifier to predict if maintenance is required, achieving 47% accuracy after handling class imbalance with SMOTE.

2. **Price Optimization**:
   - Built a Linear Regression model to optimize market prices for maximum revenue, discovering an optimal price point of $38,020.46.

3. **Product Recommendation System**:
   - Designed a Collaborative Filtering model using cosine similarity to recommend products like SpeedPack 700 and Vega 600 Plus to users.

4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identified outliers in revenue and performance using Isolation Forest, flagging critical cases for further analysis.

5. **Market Price Prediction**:
   - Trained a Random Forest Regressor, achieving an MSE of 180,347.35, to accurately predict product prices.

6. **Clustering for Product Insights**:
   - Applied KMeans clustering to group products based on production and revenue, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

7. **Revenue Trends Analysis**:
   - Conducted a time-series analysis to reveal trends in revenue over production years, driving actionable insights for business growth.

8. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Used PCA to visualize product clusters, simplifying feature dimensions for enhanced clustering insights.

## üìà Results & Impact:

- Improved operational decision-making with accurate fault detection and price optimization.
- Enhanced customer satisfaction with tailored recommendations.
- Supported data-driven strategies for inventory and market planning.
